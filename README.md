# Project 3: Mobile Flashcards
*a part of Udacity's React Nanodegree Program*

### About this Project

This is the third project of three from Udacity's React Nanodegree program. The app is a mobile application that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

This project requires the developer to use React Native to create an application for iOS and Android operating systems. The developer also needs to show that he/she understands hand to handle:

* infinite lists
* routing
* and user input

[Additional requirements can be found in the project specification here.](requirements.pdf)


### The easiest way to view the app

* Clone the repository to your desktop
* While inside the root of the repository, run the command `$ yarn install`
* After the dependencies have been installed run the command `$ yarn start`
* After that, the app should run perfectly!
